THE CODE STICHES THE FOUR 720P BMP IMAGES AND OUTPUTS THEM AS 2560X1440 RESOLUTION BMP IMAGE

I have done the code in c.

The code will ask for the file names, on running.

THE .bmp IMAGE SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE SAME FOLDER THE c PROGRAM IS PLACED.

THE BMP IMAGES SHOULD HAVE NAMES LIKE : 
      1.bmp,2.bmp,3.bmp & 4.bmp 
AND SHOULD BE IN 1280x720 RESOLUTION .bmp FORMAT 
   1280x720 RESOLUTION .bmp FORMAT
